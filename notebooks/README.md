   ```

4. Run notebooks in order (01 â†’ 05) for best results

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter import errors:
1. Ensure you've installed all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Check that you're in the correct Python environment
3. Verify Neo4j is running: `ygg db-status`

## Output

Results are saved to the `results/` directory:
- `results/data/`: Data exports and statistics
- `results/figures/`: Generated visualizations
- `results/analysis/`: Analysis reports and findings
